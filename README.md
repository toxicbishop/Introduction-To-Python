# Introduction to Python 🐍

Welcome to this repository! This collection of Python scripts is designed for beginners to learn the fundamentals of Python programming.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository contains various examples covering basic concepts, file handling, object-oriented programming, and more.

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `01a.py` | **Student Details**: Takes student inputs (Name, USN, Marks) and calculates the percentage. |
| `01b.py` | **Senior Citizen Check**: Calculates age from date of birth to determine if a person is a senior citizen. |
| `02a.py` | **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number `N`. |
| `02b.py` | **Binomial Coefficient**: Calculates the binomial coefficient (nCr) using a recursive factorial function. |
| `3.py` | **Statistics Calculator**: Calculates Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation for a list of numbers. |
| `4.py` | **Digit Frequency**: Counts the frequency of each digit in a given multi-digit number. |
| `5.py` | **Word Frequency**: Reads a file and counts the frequency of each word, displaying the top 11. |
| `6.py` | **File Sorter**: Reads lines from an input file, sorts them alphabetically, and writes them to an output file. |
| `7.py` | **Zip Directory**: Zips the contents of a specified directory into a zip file. |
| `8.py` | **Exception Handling**: Demonstrates error handling (Assertions) during division operations. |
| `9.py` | **Complex Numbers**: A Class-based approach to add two complex numbers. |
| `10.py` | **Student Class**: A Class-based approach to manage student details and marks. |

## 🛠️ Setup & Requirements

This project relies on the **Python Standard Library** (e.g., `math`, `datetime`, `os`, `sys`). Therefore, no external packages are strictly required to run these scripts.

However, a `requirements.txt` file is included for standard project structure and future extensibility.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/toxicbishop/Introduction-To-Python.git
    cd Introduction-To-Python
    ```

2. **Install requirements** (Optional):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can check by running:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd Introduction-To-Python
    ```

3. Run a specific file:

    ```bash
    python <filename>
    ```

    *Example:*

    ```bash
    python 01a.py
    ```

## 📝 Concepts Covered

- **Input/Output**: `input()`, `print()`
- **Control Structures**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `for` loops
- **Data Structures**: Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples
- **File Handling**: Reading and Writing text files
- **Functions**: Definition, arguments, recursion
- **OOP**: Classes, Objects, Constructors (`__init__`)
- **Exception Handling**: `try`, `except`, `assert`
- **Modules**: `datetime`, `math`, `os`, `zipfile`, `sys`
